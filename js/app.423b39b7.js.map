<li><strong>会打乱服务器的消息格式</strong>：JSONP要求服务器响应一段JS代码，但在非跨域的情况下，服务器又需要响应一个正常的JSON格式</li>\r\n  <li><strong>只能完成GET请求</strong>：JSONP的原理会要求浏览器端生成一个<code>script</code>元素，而<code>script</code>元素发出的请求只能是<code>get</code>请求</li>\r\n  </ol>\r\n  <p>所以，CORS是一种更好的跨域解决方案。</p><h1 id=\"article-md-title-1\">概述</h1><p><code>CORS</code>是基于<code>http1.1</code>的一种跨域解决方案，它的全称是<strong>C</strong>ross-<strong>O</strong>rigin <strong>R</strong>esource <strong>S</strong>haring，跨域资源共享。</p><p>它的总体思路是：<strong>如果浏览器要跨域访问服务器的资源，需要获得服务器的允许</strong></p><figure class=\"markdown-image\">\r\n        \r\n        <img style=\"width:auto\"

\r\n      </figure><p>而要知道，一个请求可以附带很多信息，从而会对服务器造成不同程度的影响</p><p>比如有的请求只是获取一些新闻，有的请求会改动服务器的数据</p><p>针对不同的请求，CORS规定了三种不同的交互模式，分别是：</p><ul>\r\n  <li><strong>简单请求</strong></li>\r\n  <li><strong>需要预检的请求</strong></li>\r\n  <li><strong>附带身份凭证的请求</strong></li>\r\n  </ul>\r\n  <p>这三种模式从上到下层层递进，请求可以做的事越来越多，要求也越来越严格。</p><p>下面分别说明三种请求模式的具体规范。</p><h1

<li>head</li>\r\n  </ul>\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li><p><strong>请求头仅包含安全的字段，常见的安全字段如下：</strong></p><ul>\r\n  <li><code>Accept</code></li>\r\n  <li><code>Accept-Language</code></li>\r\n  <li><code>Content-Language</code></li>\r\n  <li><code>Content-Type</code></li>\r\n  <li><code>DPR</code></li>\r\n  <li><code>Downlink</code></li>\r\n  <li><code>Save-Data</code></li>\r\n

<p>比如，在页面<code>http://my.com/index.html</code>中有以下代码造成了跨域</p><pre><code class=\"language-js\"><span class=\"hljs-comment\">// 简单请求</span>\r\n  fetch(<span

<li><strong>服务器响应头中应包含<code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin</code></strong></li>\r\n  </ol>\r\n  <p>当服务器收到请求后，如果允许该请求跨域访问，需要在响应头中添加<code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin</code>字段</p><p>该字段的值可以是：</p><ul>\r\n  <li>*：表示我很开放，什么人我都允许访问</li>\r\n  <li>具体的源：比如<code>http://my.com</code>，表示我就允许你访问</li>\r\n  </ul>\r\n  <blockquote>\r\n  <p>实际上，这两个值对于客户端<code>http://my.com</code>而言，都一样，因为客户端才不会管其他源服务器允不允许，就关心自己是否被允许</p><p>当然，服务器也可以维护一个可被允许的源列表，如果请求的<code>Origin</code>命中该列表，才响应<code>*</code>或具体的源</p><p><strong>为了避免后续的麻烦，强烈推荐响应具体的源</strong></p></blockquote>\r\n  <p>假设服务器做出了以下的响应：</p><pre><code>HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n  Date: Tue, 21 Apr 2020 08:03:35 GMT\r\n  ...\r\n  Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://my.com\r\n  ...\r\n  \r\n
